This is a proof of concept. 

I've resisted installing an ad block type of plugin for many years. After all, these ads pay for many of the things I use, so maybe they should be around me. 

Here's a compromise with Google. Installing this as a Chrome extension gives you a "curtains" link next to text and image ads that Google servers. 

As in: 

"It's curtains for you, Dr. Horrible". :)

Clicking on "curtains" removes the ad, and stores its url in your browser's Local Storage so that when you view the ad again on another page, only that specific ad will be hidden.
